Title: Explore Music Theory With Opinionated Functions

Description: A group of functions for exploring music theory, trough
    transformations of elementay blocks. Technically, the package aims at
    experimenting and demonstrating various tools and guidelines.
    This includes OOP (S3, with vctrs and tibble subclassing), strong control
    of user input and types (rlang), pure fonctionnal approach. Efforts are made 
    on providing verbs and logic to use intuitively in a tidyverse way, and on
    throwing informative and nice errors (with the cli package).
